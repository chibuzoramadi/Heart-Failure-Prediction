# Heart-Failure-Prediction


## Summary 

```text
This project was done as a final exam project for my course in University on Machine Leanring.
I believe this was not a complex project and hopefully will be inspiring to anyone looking for ideas in machine learning projects. Included in the "HFP_main" you will be able to find my work with comments and a detailed explanatory data analysis(EDA)of the dataset I used.
The project showcases basic Artificial Intelligence processes, starting from basic uploading and studying of the dataset, then preprocessing, creating a pipeline, model selection, model configuration and evaluation.
